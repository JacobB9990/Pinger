# Pinger
It is the same as the ping command on most os. It sends ICMP echo requests to a specified host and measures the round-trip time for each request. The program can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and it provides statistics such as minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times.
